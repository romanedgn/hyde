  Hey there! 
</p>

My name is Romane and I'm an MA student in Digital Humanities at King's College London.

I love data, and more specifically love analysing data with R. I also love books and using new media to tell engaging stories. 

You can find me [here](https://twitter.com/RomaneDagain), [here](https://github.com/romanedgn) and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanedagain/).
